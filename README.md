# Huffman-Code
This code implements the Huffman Coding algorithm using C++.  Huffman coding is a popular greedy algorithm used for lossless data compression. It reduces the size of data by assigning shorter binary codes to characters that appear frequently and longer binary codes to characters that appear rarely.
